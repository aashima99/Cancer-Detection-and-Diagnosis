## PROBLEM STATEMENT AND ITS SOLUTION
In a recent advance, the significance of text summarization accomplishes more attention due to data inundation on the web.  Hence, this information overwhelms yields in the 
big requirement for more reliable and capable progressive text summarizers. Text Summarization gains its importance due to its various types of applications just like the summaries of books, digest- (summary of stories), the stock market, news, highlights- (meeting, event, sport), Abstract of scientific papers, newspaper articles, magazine etc. The main advantage of a text summarization is reading time of the user can be reduced.  
This project covers the extensive methodologies fitted, issues launch, exploration and future directions in detection of Cancer.

### LIBRARIES USED

#### NLTK 
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a text processing library that is widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It supports the high-performance functions of tokenization, parsing, classification, etc. The NLTK team initially released it in 2001 (Nltk.org, 2018). 

#### Scikit-learn 
Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python. It performs easy-to-use dimensional reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering methods such as k- 10 means, regression algorithms such as logistic regression, and classification algorithms such as random forests (Scikit-learn.org, 2018). 

#### Pandas 
Pandas provides a flexible platform for handling data in a data frame. It contains many open-source data analysis tools written in Python, such as the methods to check missing data, merge data frames, and reshape data structure, etc. (“Pandas”, n.d.). 

#### Flask 
Flask, issued in mid-2010 and developed by Armin Ronacher, is a robust web framework for Python. Flask provides libraries and tools to build primarily simple and small web applications with one or two functions (Das., 2017). 

#### Bootstrap 
Bootstrap is an open-source JavaScript and CSS framework that can be used as a basis to develop web applications. Bootstrap has a collection of CSS classes that can be directly used to create effects and actions for web elements. Twitter’s team developed it in 2011 (“Introduction”, n.d.).
